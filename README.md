# Computer Science II Repository
This repository contains various Java assignments I completed for Computer Science II (CMSC 204) at Montgomery College in the Fall 2020 semester.
## Assignments
### Assignment 1
Create an application that will check for valid passwords.
#### Concepts Tested:
- ArrayList
- static
- Read Files
- Javadoc
- JUnit Tests
### Assignment 2
Create a utility class that converts an infix expression to a postfix expression, a postfix expression to an infix expression and evaluates a postfix expression.
#### Concepts Tested:
- Generic Queue
- Generic Stack
- Exception handling
### Assignment 3
Write a generic double singly-linked list class with an iterator, and a generic sorted double singly-linked list class with an iterator that inherits from your generic double singly-linked list class
#### Concepts Tested:
- Exception handling
- Generic Classes
- Double Linked List
- Ordered Double Linked List
- Iterators
- Comparators
### Assignment 4
Write a program that creates a database of courses. It will either read from a file of courses, or allow the user to add one course at a time.
#### Concepts Tested:
- Hash Table
- Link List
- Hash code
- Buckets/Chaining
- Exception handling,  
- Read/Write files using FileChooser
### Assignment 5
Write the classes required to create a Morse Code Converter Utility. The Morse Code Converter Utility is using a generic linked binary tree with generic TreeNodes to convert Morse Code into English.
#### Concepts Tested:
- Generic Classes
- Utility Class (all static methods)
- Linked Trees
- ShapeText BoxBuilding a Tree for conversion purposes
### Assignment 5
Create an application to maintain a network of towns and the roads connecting them. The application will use Dijkstraâ€™s Shortest Path algorithm to find the shortest distance between any two towns.
#### Concepts Tested:
- Implement Graph Interface
- Use Graph to maintain a network of Vertices
- Implement Shortest Path Algorithm
## Labs
### JUnit Lab
Create a JUnit Test Class for Gradebook.java, that has been provided.
### Generic Lab
Provided the DataSet class, make it into a generic DataSetGen class.
### Recursion Lab
Write a recursive method to sum the values in an array of integers. Create a file ArraySum.java and add the recursive method.
### Thread Lab
Provided the Car.java, CarPanel.java and CarFrame.java, add a CarQueue class that maintains a queue of random directions that the car should go. Modify the run method of the startAnimation in CarPanel.java so that the car will go to the right, left, up or down depending on what is retrieved from the CarQueue.
### Graph Lab
Complete answering the provided graph prompts and questions.
### Hashing Lab
Complete answering the provided hashing prompts and questions.
### Heap Sort Lab
Complete answering the provided heap sort prompts and questions.
### Tree Lab
Complete answering the provided tree prompts and questions.
